    "flavortext": "Professor Josiah Longfellow is very proud of his aristocratic roots. His family used to have money&hellip; at least until his father lost it all on gambling and alcohol. The Professor still lives with his aging mother in the rundown Victorian that used to be the finest house in town. His father disappeared one day. Ran out. His mother has a rather large life insurance policy, but of course, he doesn't want to collect on it any time soon, no matter how nice the money would be.<br /><br />Professor Longfellow knows Ox, Flash, and Heather from the university. Brandon is his paperboy. Peter mows the yard and takes care of other petty chores around the house. The Professor's greatest fear is that he will lose everything he has, proving to everyone that he's no better than his deadbeat father.",

He moved with his family to America when he was 15&hellip; and then got beaten up for the next three years. Father Rhinehardt turned to religioun for the reasons why people treated him so badly. Eventually, he entered Seminary and became a priest. Since that day, long ago, many people have confessed their sins to him. But there is one man who haunts him, every few years, a stranger who sits in the confessional and whispers of murder and madness. In recent years, Father Rhinehardt has found he's starting to agree with the madman's arguments. Blood, pain, death&mdash;they are all a part of life, of God's plan, are they not?<br /><br />Father Rhinehardt is familiar with Vivian and Madame Zostra from seeing them at the Something Written bookstore.He knows Ox from hearing him confess his petty sins.He also knows Missy from her appearances at Sunday school.More than anything, Father Rhinehardt fears going mad.",
